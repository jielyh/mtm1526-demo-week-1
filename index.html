    	we put the <script> tag at the bottom for 2 reasons:
        1.	when the browser hit <script> tag it will delay rendering with page
        	so, for usibility, if we put our <script> at the end the page will render faster
        2.	if the javascript is executed in the <head> the <body? won't be red\ndered yet
        	so we wont be able to manipulate our html
